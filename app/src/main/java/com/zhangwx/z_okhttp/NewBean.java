The 1948 Ford F-6 cabover in question features a classic cool silhouette with a modern architecture, making it a hybrid of sorts that works entirely better than it should. But sadly, you may have missed your chance at owning this one-of-a-kind Frankentruck. After being featured on Bring a Trailer yesterday, it appears the owner has pulled down the eBay listing\u2014but its still worth ogling the pictures to see this unique build.<\/p><\/div> <img class=\"picimg\" src=\"http://nrimg.ksmobile.net/cmnews/20170516/21/47365_643a52d9_149497035011_640_480.jpg\" data-img=\"2\" /> <strong class=\"pictitle\" data-title=\"2\">This 1948 Ford F-6 COE Truck Has Cop Car Underpinnings<\/strong> <div class=\"picdes\" data-des=\"2\"><p>It's got an unmistakable design that's reminiscent of yesteryear, making a great initial impression. In addition to that, it's been built upon the framework of a 2004 Crown Vic Police Interceptor that includes the cop car's 4.6L V8, giving the truck an appropriate amount of grunt to equal its style.<\/p><\/div> <img class=\"picimg\" src=\"http://nrimg.ksmobile.net/cmnews/20170516/21/32186_ec64cc8c_149497035038_640_480.jpg\" data-img=\"3\" /> <strong class=\"pictitle\" data-title=\"3\">This 1948 Ford F-6 COE Truck Has Cop Car Underpinnings<\/strong> <div class=\"picdes\" data-des=\"3\"><p>Bring a Trailer<\/p><\/div> <img class=\"picimg\" src=\"http://nrimg.ksmobile.net/cmnews/20170516/21/40319_169fff2c_149497035078_640_480.jpg\" data-img=\"4\" /> <strong class=\"pictitle\" data-title=\"4\">This 1948 Ford F-6 COE Truck Has Cop Car Underpinnings<\/strong> <div class=\"picdes\" data-des=\"4\"><p>The truck's school bus yellow paint job fits it perfectly, highlighting its curvy profile in all the right places. With untouched patina to accompany the color scheme, it's an aesthetically intact package that almost works better than a ground-up restoration.<\/p><p>The interior is decidedly simplistic, reminding you that it is indeed a vehicle from the 1940s. A bench seat in the front allows for family fun and solo cruising alike, enabling you to exercise every ounce of its updated purpose.<\/p><p>Underneath, the truck has been treated to an improved chassis that should give it better handling and a smoother ride. Though it may seem strange to build a project around a newer Crown Victoria, the sedan's body-on-frame construction is easy to modify and able to handle the truck's heavy weight without a problem.<\/p><p>Thanks to its modernized powertrain, the truck now has 125 more horsepower than it did from the factory. With enormous aftermarket support, the 4.6-liter V8 could be fitted with various bolt-ons to make this truck a screamer.

The whereabouts of the Duchess may not have been known during that time, no; however, its legacy loomed large in classic car circles. The Duchess may be, itâ\u0080\u0099s been said, the most famous Cadillac in the world.<\/p><\/div> <img class=\"picimg\" src=\"http://nrimg.ksmobile.net/cmnews/20170516/08/143653_788bae06_149492177464_640_392.jpg\" data-img=\"3\" /> <strong class=\"pictitle\" data-title=\"3\">This long-hidden Cadillac is the only U.S. car ever used by British royalty<\/strong> <div class=\"picdes\" data-des=\"3\"><p>Fit for a king<\/p><p>The carâ\u0080\u0099s story, told properly, starts in 1936, when Edward, once Prince of Wales, and then King, abdicated the throne so he could marry U.S. socialite Wallis Simpson. Now Duke of Windsor, Edward left England for New York, taking out an apartment at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel (coincidentally, itâ\u0080\u0099s the Waldorfâ\u0080\u0099s ballrooms the Fleetwood Salon is built to emulate).<\/p><p>In 1941, he commissioned a custom-built Series 62 Cadillac limousine as his personal transportation, and had the order filled by GMâ\u0080\u0099s president Alfred Sloan, who delivered Edward the car himself.<\/p><p>â\u0080\u009cThe Duchess,â\u0080\u009d as the car came to be known, cost $14,000, three times the price of a top-line Series 75, or about $235,000 in todayâ\u0080\u0099s dollars. It would be the only American car ever built for British royalty.<\/p><p>The list of custom features fitted to it is long: aside from jewellery compartments and humidors, lit vanities and cigar lighters, the Duchess was one of the first cars â\u0080\u0093 if not the first â\u0080\u0093 to have power windows. Rose-colored broadcloth and Wilton wool carpets lined the seats and floors, including the front, since Edward planned to often drive the car himself.<\/p><\/div> <img class=\"picimg\" src=\"http://nrimg.ksmobile.net/cmnews/20170516/08/333577_8f3e888b_149492177471_640_1067.jpg\" data-img=\"4\" /> <strong class=\"pictitle\" data-title=\"4\">This long-hidden Cadillac is the only U.S. car ever used by British royalty<\/strong> <div class=\"picdes\" data-des=\"4\"><p>Every fender and body panel was hand-built, and the car spoke volumes saying nothing: the Duchess instead wowed with an understated elegance. The headlight rings and other pieces were blacked-out instead of chromed; badges and trim were removed.

Then-owner Murphy held onto it instead.<\/p><p>Once in Plunkettâ\u0080\u0099s hands, it was treated to some more minor revisions â\u0080\u0093 even though it had just come off a restoration, Plunkett has some very exacting standards â\u0080\u0093 and then sent off to make its car show debut at the 2017 Amelia Island Concours dâ\u0080\u0099Elegance in Florida, one of the world\u2019s most pretigious automotive exhibitions.<\/p><p>There it was awarded the Chairmanâ\u0080\u0099s Choice Award by Bill Warner, and, fittingly, joined seven other uber-stylish autos in a retro fashion show flanked by models in period-appropriate attire.<\/p><p>Plunkett has since added the Duchess to his regular driving rotation â\u0080\u0093 he tries to drive three of his cars per day; the worst thing for them is to sit, he says â\u0080\u0093 which means, far from being lost again, or hidden in some secret collection, thereâ\u0080\u0099s a chance if youâ\u0080\u0099re in London, Ontario you may see the long, black limousine prowling around.<\/p><p>If you do, donâ\u0080\u0099t doubt yourself when the thought comes to you: yes, you may very well be looking at the most stylish automobile youâ\u0080\u0099ve ever seen.<\/p><\/div>  <!-- slide show end -->

The 1948 Ford F-6 cabover in question features a classic cool silhouette with a modern architecture, making it a hybrid of sorts that works entirely better than it should. But sadly, you may have missed your chance at owning this one-of-a-kind Frankentruck. After being featured on Bring a Trailer yesterday, it appears the owner has pulled down the eBay listing—but its still worth ogling the pictures to see this unique build.</p></div> <img class="picimg" src="http://nrimg.ksmobile.net/cmnews/20170516/21/47365_643a52d9_149497035011_640_480.jpg" data-img="2" /> <strong class="pictitle" data-title="2">This 1948 Ford F-6 COE Truck Has Cop Car Underpinnings</strong> <div class="picdes" data-des="2"><p>It's got an unmistakable design that's reminiscent of yesteryear, making a great initial impression. In addition to that, it's been built upon the framework of a 2004 Crown Vic Police Interceptor that includes the cop car's 4.6L V8, giving the truck an appropriate amount of grunt to equal its style.</p></div> <img class="picimg" src="http://nrimg.ksmobile.net/cmnews/20170516/21/32186_ec64cc8c_149497035038_640_480.jpg" data-img="3" /> <strong class="pictitle" data-title="3">This 1948 Ford F-6 COE Truck Has Cop Car Underpinnings</strong> <div class="picdes" data-des="3"><p>Bring a Trailer</p></div> <img class="picimg" src="http://nrimg.ksmobile.net/cmnews/20170516/21/40319_169fff2c_149497035078_640_480.jpg" data-img="4" /> <strong class="pictitle" data-title="4">This 1948 Ford F-6 COE Truck Has Cop Car Underpinnings</strong> <div class="picdes" data-des="4"><p>The truck's school bus yellow paint job fits it perfectly, highlighting its curvy profile in all the right places. With untouched patina to accompany the color scheme, it's an aesthetically intact package that almost works better than a ground-up restoration.</p><p>The interior is decidedly simplistic, reminding you that it is indeed a vehicle from the 1940s. A bench seat in the front allows for family fun and solo cruising alike, enabling you to exercise every ounce of its updated purpose.</p><p>Underneath, the truck has been treated to an improved chassis that should give it better handling and a smoother ride. Though it may seem strange to build a project around a newer Crown Victoria, the sedan's body-on-frame construction is easy to modify and able to handle the truck's heavy weight without a problem.</p><p>Thanks to its modernized powertrain, the truck now has 125 more horsepower than it did from the factory. With enormous aftermarket support, the 4.6-liter V8 could be fitted with various bolt-ons to make this truck a screamer. Check it out and let us know what you think in the comments.</p></div>  <!-- slide show end -->
